<h1> Hello World </h1>

<h2> HELLO </h2>

<p> testing out Github for this </p>

<p> This will hopefully fill up over time, I'm looking to remind myself the basics and advance my ability to code </p>

<p> Firstly, I've remembered enough for <b> BASIC </b> HTML, and enough commands to push to Gitbub. pages.github.io is incredible, my pointless website was a pain to manage, and with linux and command line, this is a breeze <i> for now! </i> </p>

<p> This will be my 4th commit, seems wasteful but it's cool that I can push a little bit at a time. Will probaly find a proper way to manage as time goes on. I've learned a <i> tinnnnnyyyy </i> bit of SQL, that will be useful for work going forward by maybe not here, maybe so, who knows </p>


<p> Stay tuned random person that's not me, reading this! </p>
